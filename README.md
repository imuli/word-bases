# word-base

This is a cross-linguistic mapping of numbers to semantic points, and those senses to lexemes in multiple languages.

## Structure

For each base, there is a list of semantic points (from wordnet) in bases/*base*. Semantic points may be correlated across multiple classes (verb, noun, adjective), with the primary point listed first.

Each language has a tab separated file at langs/*language* mapping semantic points to one production word and from multiple synonyms of that sense and homonyms of that word.

## Bases

### 256

256 was generated by taking the most common 3-5 letter English words (from Google's ngram analysis) and filtering for words whose primary sense was present in all Multilingual Wordnet synsets which covered more than 80% of their "core" vocabulary. The word "star" was added manually.

### 4096

Does not currently exist, but will likely be derived from the ~5000 word "core" vocabulary from Multilingual Wordnet.

## Languages

### English

English is at version 0.1.0, a set of 256 senses mapped to production words, in need of additional recognition words and probably some rearrangement.
